# premiere-league-stats

Hi, so you want to visualize some Premier League data.

## About

This project is an expansion off my previous project where I wanted to compare famous players like Messi and Ronaldo using stats from a free API. For this project I wanted to change it so I could include stats for the entire Premier League. I have playing a lot of Fantasy Soccer and wanted to get the inside scoop on player data and trends, so this was a perfect project for me.
